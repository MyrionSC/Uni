Problem 1. Write a Prolog program that does not terminate.

    base(const).
    rec(X) :- rec(X), base(X).

Problem 2. Write a Prolog program that cannot be expressed in Datalog.

    nat(x).
    nat(s(X)) :- nat(X).

    The herbrandt universe is infinite, so it cannot be expressed in datalog

Problem 3. Write a Prolog program that use an unsafe fact.

    loves(rose, X).

    It is unsafe because there is a variable in a base rule

Problem 4. The natural numbers are defined as:
Nat(Z).
Nat(S(x)) ⇐ Nat(x).
Implement the following relations on natural numbers: +, −, ×, ≤, and minimum.



Problem 5. Describe how Prolog enables computation of subtraction from addition.
Problem 6. Use Prolog to determine if the following equations have a solution:
• x = 1 + 2
• x + 2 = 3
• x × x = 3
• x × x + 1 = 26
• x ≤ minimum(x, y)
where x and y are natural numbers.
Problem 7. Implement Odd(n) and Even(n) to determine if a number is odd or even.
Problem 8. Implement the Fibonacci function.
